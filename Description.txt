Tulips are perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes that bloom in spring and die back after flowering to an underground storage bulb. A bulb can be as much as 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter or as small as 1 cm (0.4 in).[6]

Tulip stems have few leaves. Larger species tend to have multiple leaves. Plants typically have two to six leaves, some species up to 12. The tulip's leaf is cauline (born on a stem), strap-shaped, with a waxy coating, and the leaves are alternate (alternately arranged on the stem), diminishing in size the further up the stem. These fleshy blades are often bluish-green in colour.[7][8][9] The bulbs are truncated basally and elongated towards the apex. They are covered by a protective tunic (tunicate) which can be glabrous or hairy inside.[10][9] Depending on the species, tulip leaves are typically 10 and 25 cm (4 and 10 inches) long, but in some species reach over 30 cm (12 in).
