Tulipanin is an anthocyanin found in tulips. It is the 3-rutinoside of delphinidin. Tuliposides and tulipalins can also be found in tulips and are responsible for allergies.[14] Tulipalin A, or α-methylene-γ-butyrolactone, is a common allergen, generated by hydrolysis of the glucoside tuliposide A. It induces a dermatitis that is mostly occupational and affects tulip bulb sorters and florists who cut the stems and leaves.[15] Tulipanin A and B are toxic to horses, cats and dogs.
